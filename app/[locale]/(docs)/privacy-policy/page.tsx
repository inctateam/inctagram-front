          This Privacy Policy is effective as of [Effective Date]. Personal data (usually referred
          to just as „data“ below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the
          purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and
          the services offered there. Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General
          Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the „GDPR“), „processing“ refers to
          any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization,
          structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
          transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination,
          restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated
          means or not. The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about
          the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either
          under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the
          third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience
          which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control. Our
          privacy policy is structured as follows: I. Information about us as controllers of your
          data II. The rights of users and data subjects III. Information about the data processing{' '}
          <br /> I. Information about us as controllers of your data The party responsible for this
          website (the „controller“) for purposes of data protection law is: [Firma] [Vorname,
          Nachname] [Straße, Hausnummer] [Postleitzahl, Ort] Telefon: [Telefonnummer] Telefax:
          [Faxnummer] E-Mail: [E-Mail] The controller’s data protection officer is: [DSB – Vorname,
          Nachname] Telefon: [DSB – Telefonnummer] Telefax: [DSB – Faxnummer] E-Mail: [DSB – E-Mail]
          [The following information must be added if an external data protection officer has been
          appointed]. [DSB-Extern – Straße, Hausnummer] [DSB-Extern – Postleitzahl, Ort] <br /> II.
          The rights of users and data subjects With regard to the data processing to be described
          in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right to confirmation of whether
          data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed,
          further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
          also Art. 15 GDPR); to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16
          GDPR); to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or,
          alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR,
          to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR; to receive copies of the data concerning
          them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other
          providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR); to file complaints with the supervisory
          authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller
          in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR). In addition, the
          controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
          corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17
          Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is
          impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to
          information about these recipients. Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects
          have the right to object to the controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to
          Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the
          purpose of direct advertising is permissible. <br /> III. Information about the data
          processing Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon
          as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not
          in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
          <br /> Cookie Manager To obtain consent for the use of technically unnecessary cookies on
          the website, the provider uses a cookie manager. When the website is called up, a cookie
          with the settings information is stored on the end device of the user so that the request
          for consent does not have to be made on a subsequent visit. The cookie is required to
          obtain legally compliant user consent. You can prevent cookies from being installed by
          adjusting the settings on your internet browser. <br /> Cookies <br /> a) Session cookies
          We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies
          stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific
          information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address. This processing
          makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to
          display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function. The legal
          basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are
          used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships. If the processing
          does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in
          improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f)
          GDPR. When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted. <br /> b)
          Third-party cookies If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with
          whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of
          our website. Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the
          legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected
          through cookies. <br /> c) Disabling cookies You can refuse the use of cookies by changing
          the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that
          have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the
          browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the
          documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot
          prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the
          setting of your Flash player.
